This is the official GitHub download site to retrieve public versions of my Python game project, PythonPlanetball. 

Hello there! As of the great release of PPB Alpha 1.1.1, this .MD file may as well be updated ;)

To install and play PythonPlanetballs v1.1.1, first, you need to have Python and Pygame installed. the directions are listed in my website, pythonplanetball.neocities.org.
Next, you will need to download and extract the .zip file, and then drag all of the files from the extracted .zip directly onto your desktop.
Then, you can just double-click the .py file.
Finally, you will be playing Alpha 1.1.1! Enjoy! :)

If you want to edit my PythonPlanetball game files or contact me in any way, you must ask me for permission first. 

These versions are, as the filenames indicate, Alpha versions. I may not be able to update them frequently because of school, personal matters, and my YouTube channel. If I don’t update in a while, don’t worry—I’m still around (hopefully)! :)
