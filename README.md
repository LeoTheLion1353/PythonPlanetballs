As of October 6, 2025, these "games" are actually basically just Python drawings of ""stars"", so if you want to edit them and/or email me in any way, it is fine. These versions are, like it says, Alpha, and I may not be able to update much because school and work is so demanding, among other personal problems and YouTube channel related stuff, so if I don't update in a while, then don't worry, I am alive (hopefully) :)

P.S. my email is georgea446@gmail.com
